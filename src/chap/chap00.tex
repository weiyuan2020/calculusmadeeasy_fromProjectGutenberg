    \AltChapter{Prologue}

    \First{Considering} how many fools can calculate, it is
    surprising that it should be thought either a difficult
    or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to
    master the same tricks.
    
    Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are
    enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks
    of advanced mathematics---and they are mostly
    clever fools---seldom take the trouble to show you how
    easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they
    seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous
    cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.
    
    Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have
    had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg
    to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not
    hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will
    follow. What one fool can do, another can.
